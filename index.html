				<a href="secret1.html">Hello</a> My Sweet Caroline!
			</h1>
			<p class="sorry">
			I'm sorry for letting you down time and time again. I understand sorry isn't<br>
			going to cut it every time that I fail my duties as your boyfriend. I realize <br>
			that I'm getting too comfortable, and while not a bad thing, being too <br>
			comfortable is a recipe for disaster. I love you. I will never stop loving <br>
			you when you're mad at me or when I'm mad at you. Nothing in the world will <br>
			ever stop me from loving you. This little project is a mere glimpse into <br>
			how much I actually do. I hope you'll find every little thing I've hidden in here! <br>
			<br>
				Your beautiful boy,<br>
